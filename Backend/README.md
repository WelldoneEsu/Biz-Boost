## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/your-name/bizboost.git
2. Install dependencies: npm install
3. Start the application: npm start

## Set up environment variables:
- PORT=5000
- MONGO_URI=<Your MongoDB connection string>
- JWT_SECRET=<A long, random string>
- EMAIL_USER=<Your email address for sending OTPs>
- EMAIL_PASS=<Your email password or App Password>

API Endpoints
The API is structured around the /api/auth base URL. All requests should be made to these endpoints.

## Authentication
#POST /api/auth/signup
- Description: Registers a new user.
- Body (JSON): { "firstName", "lastName", "email", "password", "businessName", "phoneNumber" }

#POST /api/auth/signin
- Description: Authenticates a user and returns a JWT token.
- Body (JSON): { "email", "password" }
- POST /api/auth/requestPasswordReset
- Description: Sends a password reset OTP to the user's email.
- Body (JSON): { "email" }

## POST /api/auth/resetPassword
- Description: Verifies the OTP and updates the user's password.
- Body (JSON): { "email", "otp", "newPassword" }
- POST /api/auth/logout
- Description: Clears the user's session token.

Database Schema
The core data model is the User schema, which stores all necessary user information.

User SchemA
const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  firstName: { type: String, required: true, trim: true },
  lastName: { type: String, required: true, trim: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, unique: true, lowercase: true, trim: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true },
  businessName: { type: String, required: true },
  phoneNumber: { type: String, required: true, minlength: 11, maxlength: 15 },
  role: { type: String, enum: ['user', 'admin'], default: 'user' },
  otp: { type: String, select: false },
  otpExpires: Date,
}, { timestamps: true });
This schema is used to save and manage user data in the MongoDB database.

## Authentication & Security
- Password Hashing: User passwords are not stored in plain text. They are hashed using bcryptjs before being saved to the database.
- JWT Tokens: After successful authentication, a JSON Web Token (JWT) is issued to the client. This token is used to authenticate subsequent requests to protected routes.
- Password Reset: A secure OTP is generated and sent to the user's email, with a 10-minute expiration to prevent misuse. The OTP is also hashed before being stored in the database
